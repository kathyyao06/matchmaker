Relys on a data set collected by researchers at Columbia university as part of the paper "Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment": http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/sheena.pdf.



Tested out the term "Intersectionality" coined by Kimberl√© Crenshaw used to refer to the phenomena in anti-discrimination law where plaintiffs who brought cases alleging discrimination on two bases(e.g. sex and race) would lose cases because the sex-based discrimination claims and the race-based discrimination claims would be evaluated separately, rather than considering the intersection between different demographic categories.
